   <span style="color:violet"> The Tiny Stranger At A&co - A Narrative Poem
by Anaya</span><br>
<span style="color:lightsalmon">One day at a clothing shop,<br>
I met a man selling cats,<br>
For money he wanted to swap,<br>
But I really wanted some bats.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:turquoise">"Got any bats?" asked I.<br>
"For that's how I'll spend my money."<br>
"No bats here!" said the guy.<br>
He seemed to find it quite funny.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:aquamarine">"We've got some lovely dresses,<br>
I'll give you a very fine price."<br>
"I'd rather have some progresses."<br>
The man blinked rapidly thrice.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:orange">The man seemed exceptionally fast,<br>
And his manner was strangely amused.<br>
He wasn't what I would call lightfast,<br>
Great disdain he noticeably oozed.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:bisque">Like others, he thought I was odd,<br>
Some say I'm a bit tiny.<br>
Still he gave me a courteous nod,<br>
As if he thought I was plenty winey.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:blueviolet">So in search of my goal I departed,<br>
But before the clothing shop could I leave,<br>
The man came running full-hearted,<br>
"I can help you I believe."<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:lightslategrey">"Cats, bats, you shall find.<br>
Dresses, progresses, you can get.<br>
You must now open your mind,<br>
And get down to A&co Market.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:lightsalmon">So to A&co Market I decided to go,<br>
In search of the bats I craved.<br>
The winds it did eerily blow.<br>
But I felt that the day could be saved.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:mediumpurple">There were stalls selling shirts,<br>
Pants in many shades.<br>
There were even stalls selling miniskirts<br>
People were scattered from many trades<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:mediumseagreen">I was greeted by a peculiar lady,<br>
She seemed to be rather tiny<br>
I couldn't help thinking she might be quite shady.<br>
I wondered if she was at all winey.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:lavenderblush">Before I could open my mouth,<br>
She shouted, "For you, I have some bats!"<br>
I headed towards her, to the south,<br>
Past some dresses and cats.<br>
<br></span>
<span style="color:fuchsia">"But how did you know?" I asked,<br>
"Do you want them or not?" she did say.<br>
Silently, the bats she passed.<br>
Then vanished before I could pay.<br>
